# Team Bug Bashers' Clash of Code 2024 Grand Finale HTML Entry

For Judges:
View final.html for the final code, index.html for the earlier version to compare the performance difference.

final.html instructions: No bugs, just run! To view the code of the featured programs, click on the links. Had to convert to base64 otherwise it would not be viewable on Khan Academy. KA release link: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/gameapalooza/5642547981893632

index.html instructions: Do not edit the code. It will cause the program to break. This uses advanced ES6 JavaScript features which need to be loaded, and some features only work off-KA. I used Mushy Avocado's PJS converter library, but it has a bug where the canvas only shows up if you resize the window (in this case the program using the draggable thing seperating the code from the output). I spent a long time trying to fix the bug but it still does not work, and it is not because of my code but because of the converter. So before doing anything, please resize the window! Don't run using JSBin, JSFiddle. Those do not work either, since they use the same software for their editors Khan Academy uses.
