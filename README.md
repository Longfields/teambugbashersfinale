Note to judges:
On Khan Academy: Do not edit the code. It will cause the program to break. This uses advanced ES6 JavaScript features which need to be loaded, and some features only work off-KA.
I used Mushy Avocado's PJS converter library, but it has a bug where the canvas only shows up if you resize the window (in this case the program using the draggable thing seperating the code from the output). I spent a long time trying to fix the bug but it still does not work, and it is not because of my code but because of the converter. So before doing anything, please resize the window!

Built with IDX, a super modern cloud coding environment by Google. If you can run using IDX it would be great. Don't run using JSBin, JSFiddle. Those do not work either, since they use the same software for their editors Khan Academy uses.
